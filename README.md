- A personalized welcome message will greet you.

- A bar chart for ticket analysis.

### Ticket Management

Navigate to the `/tickets` page to manage all your support tickets.

- **Create New Ticket**: Click the "Create Ticket" button. A dialog will appear where you can enter the ticket's title, description, status, and priority.
